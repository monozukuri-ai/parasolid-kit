# parasolid-core

Python-independent Rust parser for Parasolid `X_B` and `X_T` transmit data, with
exact schema selection, bounded raw-node decoding, source byte ranges, and a
Parasolid-native B-Rep model. This crate is part of
[parasolid-kit](https://github.com/monozukuri-ai/parasolid-kit).

```toml
[dependencies]
parasolid-core = "=0.1.0"
```

Inspect a header without claiming that the geometry is supported:

```rust
use parasolid_core::{InspectionLimits, inspect_xb};

# fn inspect(bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<(), parasolid_core::ParseError> {
let header = inspect_xb(bytes, InspectionLimits::default())?;
println!("{}: nodes start at {}", header.schema_key, header.header_range.end);
# Ok(())
# }
```

For a supported exact key, select its compiled provider before parsing:

```rust
use parasolid_core::{
    BuiltinProfileRegistry, DocumentLimits, InspectionLimits, SchemaKey,
    brep::map_xb_brep, inspect_xb, parse_xb,
};

# fn parse(bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let header = inspect_xb(bytes, InspectionLimits::default())?;
let key = SchemaKey::parse(&header.schema_key)?;
let registry = BuiltinProfileRegistry::compiled()?;
let provider = registry.provider_for_key(&key).ok_or("unsupported exact schema key")?;
let document = parse_xb(bytes, &provider, DocumentLimits::default())?;
let brep = map_xb_brep(&document)?;
println!("{} bodies; complete={}", brep.bodies.len(), brep.complete);
# Ok(())
# }
```

The four compiled profiles are listed in the
[shared support matrix](https://github.com/monozukuri-ai/parasolid-kit/blob/main/docs/format-support.md#supported-profiles),
with exact keys, revisions, hashes, and separate raw/B-Rep/geometry evidence.
A supported header, schema key, or raw record does not imply complete
geometric support. An explicit
`SchemaProvider` can supply an exact external catalog; no nearby-version
fallback is performed. `SolidWorks` containers and configuration selection belong
to the caller. `SolidWorks` deltas are unsupported even when their header uses
the same supported partition key; no final saved configuration is reconstructed.
`BrepModel.complete` describes source mapping for that document. It does not
certify interpreted attributes, numerical geometry evaluation, available curved
metrics, or optional conversion. The planned iCAD container adapter has not
been created; its current evidence consists of extracted stream inputs.

Lengths and identifiers retain their Parasolid source meaning. Byte ranges are
relative to the complete byte slice supplied to the parser. Embedding applications
must track container/decompression offsets and any unit or public-ID conversion.
`write_xb` returns the retained original bytes, not an encoder for edited values.

The parser requires Rust 1.88 or newer and has no runtime dependencies, Python,
CAD installation, or network requirement. Built-in runtime, build and installation
require no external catalog. Development-only catalog comparisons and type-204
membership evidence remain described in the profile provenance; no catalog
field layouts are generated into the built-in definitions by those comparisons.
OCCT, STEP export, and preview adapters
are separate optional Python functionality in parasolid-kit. See the repository's
[format support](https://github.com/monozukuri-ai/parasolid-kit/blob/main/docs/format-support.md)
and [profile provenance](https://github.com/monozukuri-ai/parasolid-kit/blob/main/docs/builtin-profiles.md)
for the verified boundaries.

Real CAD fixtures and external schema catalogs are not included in this crate.
See the license and partial-reader provenance below.

Maintainer sanitizer and measurement procedures, including the distinction
between parser and caller resource bounds, are documented in
[resource validation](https://github.com/monozukuri-ai/parasolid-kit/blob/main/docs/resource-validation.md).

## Rust API compatibility

Starting with the first stable `0.1.0` release, patch releases in the `0.1.x`
series will preserve source compatibility for documented public Rust APIs,
including the public document/B-Rep models and `partial` reader types. Breaking
changes require a new minor series. Prereleases such as `0.1.0-dev6` remain
development releases; this policy does not retroactively make them stable.

Compatibility includes source units, IDs, byte-range origins and the distinction
between strict document parsing and bounded partial recovery described above and
in [PARTIAL_READERS.md](PARTIAL_READERS.md). Fixing acceptance of invalid input or
incorrectly interpreted values is allowed; such changes must be documented and
covered by regression tests. New profiles or recovered carriers may change
results, diagnostics and coverage, so callers must inspect the reported support
and completeness rather than assume a fixed count or treat partial recovery as
full decoding. Human-readable diagnostic text is not a stable matching key.

## Releasing

The Rust crate is published independently of Python artifacts. After updating
the workspace version and verifying the package, maintainers can run
`cargo publish -p parasolid-core --locked --dry-run`, followed by the same command
without `--dry-run`. The manual **Rust core release** workflow runs these gates;
its default is a dry run and upload requires `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` in repository
secrets. Python release events do not republish an existing Rust version.

For existing embedded fragment integrations, `parasolid_core::partial` provides
bounded topology, analytic/NURBS, and procedural-carrier readers in source units.
It does not replace schema-aware parsing or establish complete delta semantics.
See [the API boundary, provenance and licenses](PARTIAL_READERS.md).

The original implementation is MIT licensed; adopted partial readers are
Apache-2.0 licensed. This crate declares `MIT AND Apache-2.0` and distributes both
license texts.
